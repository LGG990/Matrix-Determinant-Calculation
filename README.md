# Matric Determinant Calculation
 Comparison of calculation times of NxN matrix determinants for LU decomposition method VS brute force method

Program to evaluate the determinant of a matrix using Doolittle method of LU decomposition and by brute force method.
Generation of random matrices is plotted to show how the computation time scales with matrix size.
The computation time for LU decomposition scales with n^3, where 'n' is the matrix size, and the brute force method
scales with n!.
Data sets for upto n=200 is fitted to n^3 and upto n=12 for n! using parameter estimation.
